*Fig. 1. These are the nine style explorations I did based on my initial image on the top left, using Adobe Firefly’s Generations and editing in Photoshop. The styles are: Original, Oil Painting (Vincent Van Gogh), Art Nouveau (Alphonse Mucha), Cubism (Pablo Picasso), Fauvism (Andre Derain), Horror Movie (Steven King), Yarn (DreamWorks Trolls), Cut out Paper (Bill Braun), Comic Book (Marvel Comics), Watercolor (Children’s Book - Jerry Pinkney).*

## Abstract
My project looks at an efficient workflow for creative image/video editing using Adobe Photoshop Actions tool and Batch Processing System. This innovative approach to video editing through Photoshop creates a fundamental shift to creative workflow management through the integration of industry-leading image manipulation with video editing techniques. Through systematic automation of Actions, users can achieve a simple and consistent application of visual edits across a string of images. This approach provides an alternative method to optimize productivity while ensuring uniform results across image collections through a post-processing pipeline.

## Introduction and Related Works
As a digital artist passionate about video/creative editing with movies like Wolf Walkers, The Mitchells vs The Machines and Loving Vincent as inspiration, I've found Adobe Photoshop to be an invaluable tool for both video and image manipulation *[Figure 2].* While traditionally known as an image editing tool, using “...Batch to apply Photoshop actions to batches of images” offers powerful advantages for video editing workflows (Eismann). An action, defined as “a small file of recorded instructions…[which] can be 'played' on images,” can be saved and easily replicated by an artist, enabling consistent, highly customizable, time-efficient processing of multiple video frames while maintaining style and artistic integrity (Nichols). Photoshop is geared towards “photographers of all skill levels,” and thus, some may find it more comfortable to dabble in creative video editing (Nichols). While “there is more advanced video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple’s Final Cut…this software contains more features and is more complex”, and I experimented with this process because I think Photoshop has merit to be considered as effective video editing tool and may be used in conjunction with such programs to help workflows at least in rapid prototyping or if users are unfamiliar with certain programs (David, pg. 23).

## Methodology
The process begins with a base drawing, serving as both a compositional reference and consistency anchor *[Figure 2]* For my exploration I decided to use my own character created in Photoshop, using a sketch that holds it as a clearly defined individual. I pre-select styles for artistic exploration and specific images to use for stylistic reference inputs for Firefly *[Figure 3]*  My artistic investigation spans diverse mediums and aesthetics, including Oil Painting (Impressionism), Art Nouveau, Cubism, Fauvism, Horror Movie (Steven King), Yarn (Trolls), Cut out Paper, Comic, Watercolor (Children’s Book). For each, I carefully select the parameters in Firefly to match artistic elements - color, texture, lighting – and from this, no less than 20 images are generated for each style *[Figure 4]*  It is necessary to apply the high-impact of the compositional reference, ensuring the outcomes will more closely resemble the original piece. The more time is dedicated to selecting the parameters and exploring generations, the closer one will get to an optimal outcome. The generated images then serve as either direct bases or kit-bashing components, which I refine in Photoshop to achieve a final character image that is a balance between the original design and the target style *[Figure 5]*  While some styles require minimal editing such as color correcting, others require more refinement, particularly when dealing with expressive and bold styles. In extensive cases, it may be necessary to heavily edit the image and almost entirely eliminate the AI generation elements. This systematic approach to style exploration, combining AI generation with traditional editing techniques, creates a versatile pipeline that can be adapted to various programs with similar toolsets to Firefly and Photoshop. This establishes a streamlined process with creative control and visual consistency across diverse stylistic interpretations, allowing easier visual communication among individuals in a creative pipeline with a reduced reliance on artistic creation. 

[![Assignment-2][images-fig2]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 2. This is a drawn-out pipeline demonstrating my creative process for this assignment. Starting with a clear original drawing, I pair it with whichever style exploration(s) I collect references to use to influence the generations. In Adobe Firefly, I use compositional and stylistic references on top of prompt input and filters. From this, I generate any number of images, some of which will be unusable. Of the usable generations, I select 1 or multiple to bring into the editing phase in Photoshop. Here is where kit bashing, touch-ups, cropping, color correction, filters, and other editing techniques occur. Depending on the style, this part can be more or less intensive but the result should be compositionally similar to the original drawing but should demonstrate the elements of the target style.*
[![Assignment-2][images-fig3]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 3. Here are examples of stylistic matching within my project. I have selected four of my nine images and compared them to my references which I use as stylistic references in Adobe Firefly.*
[![Assignment-2][images-fig4]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 4. This is a range of generations I did for the Yarn style influenced by the screen captures of the DreamWorks movie Trilogy Trolls. While the images largely look similar, there are small differences that persist in color, texture, lighting, etc. For this, I decided to generate no less than 20 images for each style. The more I generated and experimented, the closer I was able to lead Firefly to generate images more to my target style.*
[![Assignment-2][images-fig5]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 5. Here we see the process of editing, specifically for the Comic Book style image. From the compositional and style references, which I decided to experiment with two different comic covers from Marvel, I selected a main generation to serve as a base for my final and a secondary generation to serve as a kit bash doner. After upscaling the images in Firefly to produce higher quality images, the first step in Photoshop was to extend the crop of the image to include all of the hat. I also pulled the lower legs and feet from the doner generation. After correcting colors to better fit my original drawing, I decided to do more, and kit bash the front of the Scarecrow’s torso because the simpler style I found translated more to a comic style. After a few touch-ups, I decided that this image reached a good balance between the references.*
## Result and Future Work
My results show a mixed range of stylistic interpretations with clear ties back to my original drawing. Of the nine generations, there are three distinct groups. Horror, Yarn, and Paper Cut-Out styles fall into 3D explorations. Oil, Art Nouveau, Comic, and Storybook fall into 2D. Cubism and Fauvism presented the most challenging with extensive editing needed to reach an optimal product *[Figure 7]* I believe my results show how these programs can be pushed to help visual communication, where some styles are more easily replicable and some, while more involved in creating during the editing process, still benefit from the AI generations. I would try to pick styles that were more distinctive from each other. Some in the 2D category are very similar in principle. The most successful generations I believe come from the 3D category, which shows promise in bridging the gap between 2D references and 3D stylistic interpretations in a creative pipeline. I believe this can be expanded further to push the boundaries of what these programs can do. Other programs will likely show different strengths and weaknesses in stylistic interpretations. I am curious if similar results would stem from different characters or even drawings focusing on landscape.

[![Assignment-2][images-fig6]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 6. Here are examples of some of the unusable renders brought on by Firefly hallucinations. The majority of such hallucinations I found come from the upscale process, where the software messes up and delivers an entirely new image rather than a better-quality version of the selected image. White these are not my intended product, due to diverting more from the compositional reference, this did allow me to look at the elements of the styles in a new way and helped me fine-tune my settings to achieve generations more akin to my target style.*

[![Assignment-2][images-fig7]](https://example.com)
*Fig. 7. Of my nine generations of various styles, I found some consistency in the results. The 3-D styles [Blue: Horror Movie (Steven King), Yarn (DreamWorks Trolls), Cut out Paper (Bill Braun)] were the ones that generally required the least amount of editing outside of color correction or simile kit bashing. The general 2D styles [Green: Oil Painting (Vincent Van Gogh), Art Nouveau (Alphonse Mucha), Comic Book (Marvel Comics), Watercolor (Children’s Book - Jerry Pinkney)] required more editing to achieve their styles, whether it involved touch-ups, color correction, outlining, or more involved kit bashing. The abstract styles [Red: Cubism (Pablo Picasso), Fauvism (Andre Derain)] required the most in the editing phase. This shows that some styles are more easily replicable in Firefly, but there are methods in the editing phase that can combat this by building upon the generations.*

## Conclusion
The workflow I created successfully demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted character development, showing methods of effective collaboration between AI assistance and human creativity. Using Adobe Firefly and Photoshop, maintaining visual consistency was essential while pushing to create a variety of styles. I found some styles need more editing to better achieve the targeted style. Conversions from the 3D styles were more easily edited, while the more abstract styles required more time to edit. This shows that AI can excel for rapid concept visualization. These programs particularly show promise in parameter tuning and strategic post-processing tools to explore my chosen styles.
